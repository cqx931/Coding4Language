### Creative Coding Project II
* Use predictive models(Markov chain or RNN) to create a generative project, you can also play with word2vec for this assignment
* Predictive Models: What effect does the choice of source text have on the “output” of your project? What efforts did you try to improve the quality of the result
* Word2vec: What are the differences between the results you get from mathmatic manipulation and those based on WordNet? Can the context you created for your word2Vec project demonstrate its strength?
* Don't just show the raw generative result. Try to present it in a designed context that helps to make your piece stronger. For your next project, we are going to move our focus from content to visual presentation and reading experience.
* Potential project ideas: playing with human expectation and machine prediction, reflecting on the relationship between your generative program and you as the author/artist, data from specific context, word2vec and biased data...
